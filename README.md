Frame by Frame is a simple animation program for creating frame by frame animations. Frame by Frame was started as a hackathon project for SquirrelHacks in November 2019. The long term vision for Frame by Frame is to have it be a fully featured animation program that is simpler and easier to use compared to standard industry programs.
