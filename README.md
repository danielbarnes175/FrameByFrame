# Frame by Frame

A simple animation program for creating frame by frame animations. This project was started as part of SquirrelHacks in November 2019. I am hoping to expand upon it further than what I worked on at the hackathon.

## Demo

Here is a video showing off the project: https://youtu.be/1b9OknXMA1E

## Disclaimer

Additionally, the code here is kind of awful. There were many moments during the hackathon where I was tired and I did not abstract my code nearly as much as I should have. There is a lot of code duplication, and classes with tons of code, making them a little hard to follow. Down the line I plan to do a complete refactor, but for the sake of showing off what I did in the hackathon, I will be keeping it for at least a little while.
