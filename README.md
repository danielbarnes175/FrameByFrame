Frame by Frame is a simple animation program for creating frame by frame animations. Frame by Frame was started as a hackathon project for SquirrelHacks in November 2019. The long term vision for Frame by Frame is to have it be a fully featured animation program that is simpler and easier to use compared to standard industry programs. 

## Demo

Here is a video showing off the project: https://youtu.be/1b9OknXMA1E

This demo is based off of the initial project immediately after the hackathon in November 2019, so it may not reflect the project in its current state.
